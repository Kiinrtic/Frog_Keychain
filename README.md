# Frog_Keychain
A Frog shaped PCB keychain with 4 LEDs and a switch. The frog lights up when the switch is pressed. This project doesn't have any major featuresâ€”it's just a fun, personalized creation.
This was my first pcb made  for the [solder event at hackclub](http://solder.hackclub.com/). I am very grateful that I got the chance to experience making circuits and wiring components. Thak you hackclub!
